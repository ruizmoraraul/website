								<h2>About Me!</h2>
								<p>My name is Ra√∫l Ruiz, and I a master's student at <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">
								Institute of Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)</a>. My main interest are matehmatical logic
								and its algebraic part.</p>
								
								<p>I created this website to upload the documents and memories that I did in my Bachelor (Universal algebra)
								and the ones that I'm surrently doing at the master (Logic).</p>
								
								<p>My interest in logic and algebra
								became when I studied general algebra (groups and rings) in my bachelor. After that, I started reading
								some introductory books about logic and finally, I discovered that one of my professors was, precisely,
								studying in a field which combines both of my passions.</p>
								
								<p>Now, I am doing a master's course in logic at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en">
								University of Amsterdam (UvA)</a>. Learning from the syntactic part of logic (proof theory and lambda calculus)
								to the more semantic and algebraic one (model theory, modal logic and mathematical structures in
								logic).</p>
