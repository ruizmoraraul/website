								<h3>Bachelor's thesis.<h3>
								<p class="gray">Els teoremes d'isomorphisme en àlgebres heterogènies
								(Isomorphism theorems in many-sorted algebras)</p>
								</header>
								
								<p>My Bachelor's thesis we tutored by <a href="https://www.uv.es/coslloen/">Enric Cosme Llópez</a>.
								As a way of show me a part of his actual research Enric proposed me to write my thesis about the most
								general extension of the isomorphism theorems once stated by Emmy Noether 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems"><i class="fab fa-wikipedia-w"></i></a>.</p>
								
								<p>In the document, once set up the historical context of the main theorems and 
								the preliminaries about many-sorted sets, we define many-sorted algebras and all its related concepts
								(many-sorted subalgebras, many-sorted homomorphisms and many-sorted congruences). Moreover, as way of extending
								the work we prove some other isomorphism-like results arising relations between direct products and subdirect products. 
								Finally, we prove the three isomorphism theorems for such structures and we describe an application of them to prove 
								that any algebra is isomorphic to the quotient of the correspondat free algebra.</p>
