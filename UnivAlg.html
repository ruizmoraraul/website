								<h2>Universal algebra</h2>
								<p> I did a Bachelor in Mathematics at the University of Valencia. As part of it I collaborated
								with the department of Mathematics (concretely, the area of algebra) under the tutoring of
								<a href="https://www.uv.es/coslloen/">Enric Cosme Llópez</a>.</p>
								
								<p> When I expressed Enric my interests about the algebraics aspects of logic he proposed me
								to work in an introduction in universal algebra 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra"><i class="fab fa-wikipedia-w"></i></a>.
								Concretely, the course I lectured (18 h) was thought as an introduction to this field with three
								objectives in mind: the isomorphism theorems, Birkhoff theorem about varieties and Mal'cev conditions.</p>
								
								<p> The lectures were streamed though youtube and can be found in the personal youtube channel of
								Enric Cosme (they are in catalan)
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_e3OukXk6rlvvURcQw5ZA/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-play"></i> Lecture videos</a>.
								Moreover, I wrote some lecture notes which are also avaliable (also in catalan)
								<a href="./docs/AlgUniv.pdf" download=""><i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Lecture notes</a>.
								At the moment I'm working on an english and more complete version of the lecture notes.</p>
