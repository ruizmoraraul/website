								<h2>Universal algebra</h2>
								<p> I did a Bachelor in Mathematics at the University of Valencia. As part of it I collaborated
								with the department of Mathematics (concretely, the area of algebra) under the tutoring of
								<a href="https://www.uv.es/coslloen/">Enric Cosme Llópez</a>.</p>
								
								<p> When I expressed Enric my interests about the algebraics aspects of logic he proposed me
								to work in an introduction in universal algebra 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra"><i class="fab fa-wikipedia-w"></i></a>.
								Concretely, the course I lectured (18 h.) was thought as an introduction to this field with three
								objectives in mind: the isomorphism theorems, Birkhoff theorem about varieties and Mal'cev conditions.</p>
								
								<p> The lectures were streamed though youtube and can be found in the personal youtube channel of
								Enric Cosme (they are in catalan)
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_e3OukXk6rlvvURcQw5ZA/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-play"></i> Lecture videos</a>.
								Moreover I wrote some lecture notes which are also avaliable (also in catalan)
								<a download="" href="./CV/CVRaulRuiz.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Lecture notes</a>.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<p> I did my practicum as part of my bachelor's course in mathematics
										in the area of algebra in the department of mathematics of the faculty of the University of Valencia. 
										They were tutored by <a href="https://www.uv.es/coslloen/"> Enric Cosme Llópez</a> contractat doctor of the university.
										Because of my interest in algebraic structures, its abstraction and mathematical logic, 
										he offered me the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra"> universal algebra</a>.
										The main interest of such branch of algebra is to study algebraic structures in its own rather than its algebraic models.</p>
